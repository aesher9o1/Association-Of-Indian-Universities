                   The activities of Students Information started at AIU in the year 1927 in the form of Publication of Universities Handbook. In the year 1997, a Division named as Students Information Services was set up. The Division provides extensive information on university institutions, professional bodies, accredited courses conducted by all types of universities, teaching staff of university departments, etc. It brings out comprehensive Universities Handbook giving detailed information about the universities, their faculty, administration, disciplines in which it offers courses at all levels. It also brings out handbooks on professional courses including Management Education, Engineering Education, Health Sciences Education, Computer Education and Distance Education. The Division provides information to the stakeholders in India on their eligibility for admission to an Indian university or on the standing of an institution through e-mail, post and telephone. Now, the Division has revised and updated the Universities Handbook (34th Edition), which is in press.
